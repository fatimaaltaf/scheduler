# 📅 Scheduler 📅 

Scheduler allows you to make an appointment with an interviewer on a specific day of the week. If you change your mind, you can delete your appointment or edit who you want to be interviewed by. Scheduler is a single-page app with a clean interface and easy to navigate.

I built this app using React, Webpack, Babel, Axios, Storybook, Webpack Dev Server. I used Jest and Cypress for testing. 

## 📝 Let's make a few appointments! 📝

Here's a sneak-peek of what Scheduler looks like:

## 💻How to use 💻

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm start` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8000/>. 
5. Both servers run concurrently; requests are proxied from the Webpack development server to the API server. 
6. Go to <http://localhost:8000/> in your browser.
7. Select a day of the week and add your appointment where a time slot is available. 
8. If you're unhappy with your appointment, you can edit your appointment or delete it. 
10. Have fun scheduling! 🥳
